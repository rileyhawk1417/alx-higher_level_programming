# Description

This project is using an old library called [request](https://github.com/request/request) yes its deprecated but pretty useful for practicing.
On my machine I have [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).
Those two make it tricky to access any global modules.
If you don't have the two by all means run `npm install -g request`
If they are there well just run `pnpm add request` (helps with space)

If you want to run the examples `./file_name`
if some files fail take a look inside & hopefully it makes sense
